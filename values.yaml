# Airlock IAM - application setup
#
# Define how the deployment will look like, what applications are activated and how they behave.
# Knowledge of Airlock IAM terms and concepts is not absolutely required but probably very helpful.

iam:
  ## Name of the Airlock IAM configuration instance
  ## - default is 'auth'
  ## - needs to match the folder name of the instance on the config volume
  instanceName: "auth"

  ## Format of the configuration file
  ## - valid values: yaml, xml
  ## - it is very strongly recommended to use the yaml format unless you have existing tooling
  ##   which modifies the file medusa-configuration.xml
  configFormat: "yaml"

  ## Active configuration environment
  ## - must match an environment identifier in the configuration file
  environmentId: ""

  ## License
  ## - Airlock IAM requires a valid license to run
  ## - Create secret: kubectl create secret generic <name> --from-file=license.txt=<filename>
  ## -  or configmap: kubectl create configmap <name> --from-file=license.txt=<filename>
  license:
    name: "airlock-iam-license"
    type: "cm"

  ## IAM web applications
  ## - for tests, all applications can be part of one deployment
  ## - for production and production-like test environments, it is recommended to split the applications
  ##   into separate deployments with individual settings, e.g. number of replicas
  apps:
    ## Loginapp
    ## - only the settings for the loginapp are documented in detail
    ## - the other applications provide the same properties
    loginapp:
      ## URL path to the loginapp
      ## - default is /<instanceName>-login
      path: ""

      ## Activation
      ## - activate only those applications which are required for your use case
      ## - see also sandbox.enable (further down)
      enable: true

      ## Settings for a "sandboxed" (individual) deployment of loginapp
      sandbox:
        ## Enable sandbox
        ## - if set to false, the loginapp is deployed as part of a shared deployment, together with other applications
        enable: false

        ## Naming suffix
        ## - allows to append a special tag to the name to differentiate from other deployments
        ## - by default, set to name of application, e.g. loginapp
        suffix: ""

        ## Number of replicas to schedule
        replicas: 1

        ## Each instance requires some settings to define its logging, Java options and other os-level integrations
        ## These settings are defined in their own section, under iam.instanceProperties (see further down).
        ## Each set of settings has a name which can be referenced here.
        ## If name is not set here, the first item in iam.instanceProperties is used.
        propertiesName: ""

        ## Airlock IAM uses an instance directory from which it reads the configuration and other resources.
        ## Applications can share the same volume or use individual ones.
        persistence:
          ## Volume for instance configuration
          config:
            ## Enable, if the loginapp requires its individual instance directory.
            enable: false

            ## Volume type
            ## - request: a PersistentVolumeClaim manifest is created to request storage
            ## - existing: an existing PersistentVolumeClaim is used for storage
            ## - remote: storage from a remote server is mounted as volume
            ## - subpath: the storage refers to a (sub)path on an already existing volume
            ## - hostpath: the storage refers to a directory on the Kubernetes node
            type: "request"

            ## The storage class to use for the PVC
            ## - for type 'existing'
            storageClass: ""

            ## Volume access restrictions
            ## - valid values: ReadWriteOnce, ReadWriteMany, ReadWriteOncePod, ReadOnlyMany
            ## - for types 'request,existing,remote'
            accessMode: "ReadWriteOnce"

            ## Name of existing PVC

            volumeName: ""
            subPath: ""

            ## Allocated size
            ## - for types 'request,existing,remote'
            size: "10M"

            ## Specify the mount
            ## - for type 'remote'
            remote:
              ## Network file system type
              ## - many possible values, e.g. nfs
              type: ""

              ## server and path of mount
              server: ""
              path: ""

            ## Hostpath mount
            ## - do not use unless you know what you are doing
            ## - only for test environments or local administration setups
            ## - never use for production or production-like test environments - you have been warned
            ## - on Rancher Desktop, use a value like "/mnt/c/Users/<user>/Documents/Airlock/IAM"
            hostPath: ""

          ## Volume for log files
          ## - by default, logs are written to stdout
          ## - historically, Airlock IAM has written its log to files - which may be preferred by some administrators
          ##   as they are used to the format
          ## - if enabled, log files are usually written to the instance directory
          ## - specify logs volume to write logs somewhere else
          ## - properties are the same as documented for config (above), except where noted
          logs:
            enable: false

            storageClass: ""

            ## With replicas>1, StatefulSets are used instead of Deployments causing a PVC to be created per replica.
            ## The retention policy defines what to do when replicas are scaled down or the StatefulSet is deleted.
            ## - valid values: Delete, Retain
            ## - with Retain, manual cleanup is required
            ## - as volume contains only log data which should have been forwarded to Elasticsearch, anyway,
            ##   it should be quite safe to just remove

## Network service
## These settings will be used for each service for Each deployment
## - Container and service ports are fixed - do not change them using environment variables

  ## It is strongly recommended to not change the service type
  ## Communication to Airlock IAM should be routed over ingress and/or Airlock Microgateway
  type: "ClusterIP"

## Data communications ingress
## - make Airlock IAM accessible from the outside
ingress:
  ## Type of ingress
  ## - valid values: microgateway, gatewayAPI, ingress, httpproxy
  ## - it is strongly recommended to use either microgateway or gatewayAPI
  type: "gatewayAPI"

## Authentication and self-service processes usually require multiple data exchanges between client and server.
## For security reasons, corresponding state information is not exposed to the client but retained on the server.
## To allow for Kubernetes scheduling, with pods started or terminated according to load, state must stored
## where it can be reloaded by any replica.
## For this, a Redis server is used.
## If replica is set to any number greater than 1, it is strongly recommended to enable Redis - and change
## the IAM configuration, accordingly.
redis:
  enable: false
  replica:
    replicaCount: 2
  sentinel:
    enabled: true

## Almost all functionality in Airlock IAM requires a database (users, groups, authentication devices etc.)
## The database used is defined in the configuration and not as part of the deployment.
## It is very common to make us of an existing database cluster, potentially operated outside of the Kubernetes cluster.
## For in-cluster database setups, this Helm chart relies on database operators.
## Consequently, it does not try to manage a full db setup but creates appropriate manifests:
## - PostgresSQL: https://cloudnative-pg.io
## - MariaDB: https://github.com/mariadb-operator/mariadb-operato
database:
  ## Configure the external database
  external:
    ## Activation
    ## - enable to use an external database
    ## - conflicts with database.mariadb.enable and database.postgresql.enable
    ## - only one of these may be set to true
    enable: false

    ## Database engine
    ## - the type of the  external database
    ## - valid values: mysql, mariadb, postgresql, mssql, oracle
    type: "mariadb"

    ## Database host
    ## - append port, if required, separated by colon, e.g. 'myhost:1234'
    host: "db.example.com"

    ## Database name
    database: "airlock_iam"

    ## Database access credentials
    ## - specify username & password to access database
    ## - preferably, use pre-existing secret
    ## - if secretName is defined, it is expected to contain the specified key
    credentials:
      ## The datrabase account (and its password) to access the Airlock IAM database
      user:
        ## Username to access database
        ## - ignored if existingSecret is set
        value: "airlock_iam"
  
        ## Name of existing secret containing username
        ## - overrides username setting
        existingSecret: ""
  
        ## Key for username in existing secret
        key: "db_user"
  
      password:
        ## Password to access database
        ## - ignored if existingSecret is set
        value: "a very hush and absolutely not well known secret"
  
        ## Name of existing secret containing password
        ## - overrides password setting
        existingSecret: ""
  
        ## Key for password in existing secret
        key: "db_password"
  
      ## A privileged datrabase account (and its password) authorized to create databases and define tables
      ## - only required if database.initialisation.schema.operation=init
      ## - properties are the same as documented for database.external.credentials.user & password (just above)
      rootUser:
        value: "root"
        existingSecret: ""
        key: "root_user"
      rootPassword:
        value: ""
        existingSecret: "airlock-iam"
        key: "root_password"
  
  ## Configure MariaDB deployed from this chart
  ## - ref: https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/mariadb
  mariadb:
    ## Activation
    ## - enable to use an external database
    ## - conflicts with database.external.enable and database.postgresql.enable
    ## - only one of these may be set to true
    enable: false

    ## Rest of MariaDB configuration
    ## Unfortunately, Helm is pretty limited when it comes to passing values from a parent to a child chart
    ## Such values must be defined in the parent values.yaml (this file) under the key '<name-of-subchart>'
    ## In the case of MariaDB, look for a top-level key 'mariadb' towards the end of the file.
  
  ## Configure PostgreSQL deployed from this chart
  ## - see https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/postgresql
  postgresql:
    ## Activation
    ## - enable to use an external database
    ## - conflicts with database.external.enable and database.mariadb.enable
    ## - only one of these may be set to true
    enable: false

    ## Rest of PostgreSQL configuration
    ## Unfortunately, Helm is pretty limited when it comes to passing values from a parent to a child chart
    ## Such values must be defined in the parent values.yaml (this file) under the key '<name-of-subchart>'
    ## In the case of PostgreSQL, look for a top-level key 'postgresql' towards the end of the file.
  
  ## Initialisation
  initialisation:
    ## Java database connector
    ## - Airlock IAM requires a Java database connector which is not part of the container image (for legal reasons)
    ## - can be provided as part of the instance directory (see 'persistence'), usually in directory <instanceName>/libs or common/libs
    ## - chart can launch a job which downloads connector to instance directory
    connector:
      ## Enable automatic download
      download: false
  
      ## Select relevant connector
      mariadb:
        ## Version of connector to download
        ## - needs to be specified
        version: "3.5.5"
  
        ## Package mirror to download from
        ## - default is 'MvA Internet Services GmbH, Zurich'
        mirrorHost: "https://mirror.mva-n.net"
  
      postgresql:
        ## Version of connector to download
        ## - needs to be specified
        version: "42.7.7"
  
        ## Package mirror to download from
        ## - default is 'MvA Internet Services GmbH, Zurich'
        mirrorHost: "https://jdbc.postgresql.org"

    ## Schema
    ## - create or upgrade database schema
    ## - uses the schema scripts as published on the documentation site, see https://docs.airlock.com/iam/latest/index/1579527945303.html
    schema:
      ## Define the applied operation
      ## - valid values: none, init, upgrade
      ## - init: create database if it does not yet exist
      ## - upgrade: apply schema upgrade scripts from https://docs.airlock.com when upgrading Airlock IAM
      ## - schema initialisation will use root user credentials to connect, see below
      operation: "none"

    ## Adminapp administrator
    ## - only relevant for operation 'init'
    administrator:
      ## Automatically create the administrator account for adminapp
      create: false

      ## For default passwords, administrator should be forced to change password at first login
      enforceChange: true

      ## Credentials
      ## - specify username & password for admin account
      ## - only relevant for database.initialisation.schema.operation=init and database.initialisation.schema.createAdministrator=true
      ## - preferably, use pre-existing secret
      ## - if secretName is defined, it is expected to contain the specified key
      ## - properties are the same as documented for database.external.credentials.user & password
      credentials:
        name:
          value: "admin"
          existingSecret: ""
          key: "admin_user"

        ## Hash of administrator password
        ## - depends on Airlock IAM application configuration (which password hash?)
        ## - cannot be calculated by Helm chart
        ## - define the correct hash value, e.g. 'MedusaPwdHistoryAAAARjE2Mzg0fF1jjOhya0ZuJ5OrHXgSXznOBBLl6eJ70PTdFYerSYPwgrlK1uq6UCzc5cvN8t1xtgc+YBQO8UgWBYhzDgpkQGM='
        pwd_hash:
          value: ""
          existingSecret: "airlock-iam"
          key: "admin_password"

    ## When to pull the image.
    pullPolicy: "IfNotPresent"
  
    ## Name of secret for protected images
    ## - required to pull Airlock IAM from the Airlock-maintained repository at quay.io

    pullSecret: ""

## Environment variables for shared deployment
## - can be used to define settings for the instance.properties file by using the parameter name in all caps,
##   with punctuation such as "-" and "." replaced with "_". E.g. IAM_LOGINAPP_REST_UI_CUSTOMIZATIONS=instances/auth/designs/ui.zip
## - defined as a map, e.g. "varname: value"
## - these settings are overwritten by environment variable settings for iam.instanceProperties.env, iam.shared.env, and iam.apps.<app>.sandbox.env
